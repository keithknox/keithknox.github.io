<h1>Which two websites are you inspired by?:</h1>

<p><a href="http://coombearchitecture.com">Coombe Architecture</a></p>

<p>Going by the website, Nick Coombe is an architect who specializes in museum exhibitions and<br> his website flows like one.  It eschews the tradtional downward-scrolling format of a website and<br> decides to take the user through an exhibtion of its own.  Clever, but not very practical.</p> 

<p><a href="http://www.arko.co.nz/">Arko</a></p>
<p>A simple, yet elegant website with an easy flow and functionality.</p> 

<p>(both were found via <a href="www.siteinspire.com">siteinspire</a>)</p>

<h1>>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h1>
<p>>In order to disply its photos in a side-scrolling environment without putting the user to<br> sleep, Coombe Architecture displays its photos in a wave pattern, rising and falling from one<br> photo to the next.  This display helps maintain an overall visual balance between positive and<br> negative space while focusing on the exhibition photos.</p>

<p>On the Arko Page, 

<h1>What makes them similar and different?</h1>
<p>They are similar in the sense that both sites want you to view their work, but they go about it<br> in different ways.  Coombe has a more playful approach however it's not very practical. <br> You are greeted with a wall of text with his ocntact info at the very front of the page.  If you<br> make it to the end, you do have to scroll all the way back to the left in order to find his contact info.</p>>

<p>On the Arko page, not only does it flow easily from project-to-project, but you can access any<br> point of the page from anywhere.  The navigation is simple, yet effective and at any <br>time you can contact Arko by looking at the footer.  A much more functional website.</p>


<p>And now, with my very limited knowledge of design, I will try to re-work the Coombe<br> Architecture website:</p>
