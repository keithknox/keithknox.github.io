<h1>Which two websites are you inspired by?:</h1>

<p><a href="http://coombearchitecture.com">Coombe Architecture</a></p>

<p>Going by the website, Nick Coombe is an architect who specializes in museum exhibitions and<br> his website flows like one.  It eschews the tradtional downward-scrolling format of a website and<br> decides to take the user through an exhibtion of its own.  Clever, but not very practical.</p> 

<p><a href="http://www.arko.co.nz/">Arko</a></p>
<p>A simple, yet elegant website with an easy flow and functionality.</p> 

<p>(both were found via <a href="www.siteinspire.com">siteinspire</a>).</p>

<h1>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h1>
<p>In order to disply its photos in a side-scrolling environment without putting the user to<br> sleep, Coombe Architecture displays its photos in a wave pattern, rising and falling from one<br> photo to the next.  This display helps maintain an overall visual balance between positive and<br> negative space while focusing on the exhibition photos.</p>

<p>The Arko Page has a very Zen-like quality to it.  The white background contrasts with black<br> type.  Because this background is so simple, it tends to fade away and make the photos really<br> stand out.  Not bad for a concrete company.</p>

<h1>What makes them similar and different?</h1>
<p>They are similar in the sense that both sites want you to view their work, but they go about it<br> in different ways.  Coombe has a more playful approach, however it's not very practical. <br> The user is greeted with a wall of text with contact info at the very front of the page.  If <br> the user makes it to the end they will have have to scroll all the way back to the left in order to find the contact info.</p>

<p>On the Arko page, not only does it flow easily from project-to-project, but the user can<br> access any point of the page from anywhere.  The navigation is simple, yet effective and at any <br>time the user can contact Arko by looking at the footer.  A much more functional website.</p>


<p>And now, with my very limited knowledge of design, I will try to re-work the Coombe<br> Architecture website:</p>

<p>Putting a small photo gallery at the top of the home page is my plan to grab the user's attention. If the user <br>likes what they see, I would offer a peek of the logo and menu bar just above the fold so that the user will <br>scroll down. The plan is also to keep contact info and social media links in the footer so that the user never<br> loses track of how to contact me. This info would also be copied on all the following pages as well.</p>
<img src = "Diagram2.jpeg">
<p>Project page would not radically differ from the main page.  The gallery would be the focal point although a small<br> amount of space would be sacrificed in order to fit the summary text.  The user would be able to click on any gallery<br> slide and get a brief summary of the project being displayed.  To the left the user would be able to access other<br> projects based on title (in case the user is looking for a certian project) and below that would be additional thumbnail<br> views of the associated photos. The idea behind this page is that since I now have the user's attention,<br> the focus on the photos has diminished and a deeper explanation of the projects has come to the forefront.</p>
<img src= "Diagram3.jpeg">
<p>The awards page, would be a little something of a departure.  I would feature key phrases from a positive review with<br> an image thumbnail linking to the correlating project to the right or left of the quote.  This would be a<br> departure from the other pages since this time the focus of the page is now on words instead of images.</p>
